# PassGen

PassGen is a basic password generator that allows users to create password between 4-20 characters.
These characters can be letters (including uppercase letters), numbers or symbols from the next set: 
* !#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[]^_{|}~

PassGen is made as a practise project with HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS.
